        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        
        Long term goals:
I personally don’t enjoy the nature of selling labour, I want to establish a way of living that somehow balances financial stability and having an excessive amount of free time.

Personal strengths and weaknesses:
I suppose my strengths would be my detail oriented thinking and patience. I cannot manage multiple acitivities well at the same time, I tend to thrive more on micro-level skills and I am naturally more attentive and focused when rules are ambiguous. This has made learning very hard for me in the past because I don’t learn well in classrooms and I also don’t have the self-discipline to learn successfully on my own. In all the schools I have been to (I moved around quite a lot) my grades have always been bad despite the hours and work I’ve put in which made me question my learning ability and IQ. Art school has been really healing for me and I think it has given me the confidence to try Web Development.

Managing workload and working with people:
I hope to see myself show more initiative and commitment working with people because I tend to work alone or be very selective with whom I work with which is not helpful. 
In order to work productively with others in this programe, I will keep my my part-time working hours to the bare minimum so I can be present as much as possible. I have had a lot of stressful and time-consuming things happen during the previous few sprints and it has taught me a lot about prioritising and time-management. I will try my best to make plans for my learning as well as other obligations. 
To list some of my current obligations, I have a part-time 16 hour job which are mostly scheduled for Fridays and Sundays now and weekends once the bootcamp begins. I have a jewellery commission which has no deadline but I would like to finish it before Christmas.

I am super lucky to have friends who have graduated from Dev Academy and are willing to help me. I think my biggest challenge so far is accepting help and managing my time in a sustainable way.

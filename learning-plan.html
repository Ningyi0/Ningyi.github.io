        <h1>Cultural Blog-Learning Plan-Sprint 2</h1>
        
        <h2>Personal strengths and weaknesses:</h2>

        <p>
            I suppose my strengths would be my detail oriented thinking and patience. I cannot multi-task well, I tend to thrive more on micro-level skills and I am naturally more attentive and focused when rules are ambiguous. I enjoy constructing my own methodologies and I am usually more productive at night or after 4pm.  
        </p>
        <h2>Managing workload and working with people:</h2>
        <p>
            I hope to see myself show more initiative and commitment working with people because I used to be very selective with whom I work with which is not helpful. From collaborations and work experiences in the past, I have avoided free handing and leaving things open to chance which can be resolved by me having more curiosity in different possibilities instead of thinking as a critic or assigning too much pressure and meaning to the project.  I have also learnt that asking questions and checking in instead of making assumptions is a good habit. 

            In order to work productively with others in this programme, I will communicate more and practice active listening, keep other obligations to the bare minimum so I can be present as much as possible, and reciprocate the energy and hard work from others to the best of my abilities without overstepping my limits and boundaries. 
            
            I have had a lot of stressful and time-consuming things happen during the previous few sprints such as moving and starting work in a new field, and it has taught me a lot about prioritising and time-management. I will try my best to make plans for my learning as well as other obligations. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no previous experience with coding so I am unsure what to expect in bootcamp or what my needs would be, but so far I think I am not great at learning from home. But I am super lucky to have friends who have graduated from Dev Academy and are willing to help me. I think my biggest challenge so far is accepting help and managing my time in a sustainable way.

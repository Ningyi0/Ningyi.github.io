    <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
    
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.

    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
      This angered the local Te Rarawa people who gave chase to take back their kumara but they were unable to catch Te Houtaewa. His raiding of the kumara pit was the reason of significant mamae (pain) for the Te Rarawa people and fueled the whawhai (conflict) between the tribes.
    </p>
    <p>Te Houtaewa returned home with his two keke of kumara and his journey took only a little longer than the time to prepare the hangi. Over the years whawhai continued between the tribes and payback eventually occured as Te Houtaewa was shot and killed at Houhora harbour and his legs were taken as means to capture his mana (prestige) - his agility, strength and swiftness as a runner.  </p>

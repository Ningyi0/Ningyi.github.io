        <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          I have discovered though core learning that I have an extreme approach to failure and mistakes. I tend to set high expectations for myself despite knowing my weaknesses, then losing motivation altogether when things don’t go as well as anticipated. I’ve also noticed I put things like ‘logic’ or ‘mathematical thinking’ on a pedestal because it seems like this internal trait or ability defines one’s learning capability, when sometimes it’s just a matter of following instructions and putting in the work. I’ve also noticed about myself through core learning that I still have a long way to go in terms of facilitating the best learning environment for me both physically and mentally because I am constantly surrounded by distractions that impacts my well-being.

          I reckon the roles of values, empathy, and  self-awareness in learning and programming are crucial and substantial roles because they define a person and their approach to unfamiliar things. I think programming has a lot to do with being comfortable with the unknown and having the confidence to figure things out. Self-awareness plays a big part in this process.

          I was surprised the most with the intersectionality of core learning because I wasn’t expecting there to be one. I find it very enlightening and refreshing that this isn’t just textbook content from years ago about being nice and having people skills. It unpacked some interesting things across different fields that wasn’t expected.

          I find the time limit for core learning challenging because I enjoy reflecting and writing but I tend to over edit and delete a lot of my blogs. I like that there is a time box for everything but I think following through especially when writing is involved is super difficult.

          I feel like having core learning in this curriculum is important because it creates transparency and also forms a learning documentation which is useful for tracking progress.

        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths-Sprint 1</h1>
        <p>
        I believe my strengths and weaknesses have a lot to do with my use of time. I engage in time-consuming activities more often than ones that require efficiency and productivity. 
        I think this habit of dismissing time and working at my own pace has affected my learning because I am naturally drawn to crafting tangible things instead of creating solutions because solutions comes from a problem and usually has a deadline as well. In comparison I enjoy details and context.
        </p>

            My identity is at the lion stage in Nietzsche’s Three Metamorphoses story. Socially and economically, I have based a lot of my decisions on selecting the remaining option to what I don’t want to do because of the weird power dynamic between individuals and capitalism.

            As an animal, I would be a scaled lizard or chameleon that sits in the sun absorbing heat everyday next to dehydrated plants because my body temperature has been set too low at default. 
            As a piece of furniture, I would be a metal barstool because they hurt in the winter.
            As food, I would be 大碴粥, a congee made from split corn that is usually consumed for breakfast.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value empathy because I believe everyone will inevitably and unintentionally produce conflict with others by just being themselves and there is no solution for this because it would require definite means to judge right from wrong. This is impossible given the complexities of cultures and morals and personal experiences so empathy is an important aspect in resolving misunderstandings and conflicts.
